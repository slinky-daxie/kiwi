## Quick Reference for CS Agents

This document summarizes EU Regulation 261/2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding, cancellations, or long delays.

## When EU261 Applies

### Geographic Scope

- **Flights arriving in EU** (EU airline only)
- Includes Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and UK

### Passenger Requirements
- Valid booking confirmation
- Presented for check-in on time
- Not denied boarding due to health, safety, or security reasons

## Compensation Amounts

Compensation is based on flight distance and delay length:

### Short Distance (<1,500 km)
- **Delay >3 hours or cancellation**: €250 per passenger
- Examples: London to Paris, Berlin to Rome

### Medium Distance (1,500-3,500 km)

### Long Distance (>3,500 km)
- **Delay 3-4 hours**: €300 per passenger
- **Delay >4 hours**: €600 per passenger
- Examples: London to New York, Paris to Dubai

## Airline Exemptions (Extraordinary Circumstances)

Airlines are NOT required to pay compensation if delay/cancellation caused by:
- Severe weather conditions
- Political instability
- Security risks
- Air traffic control restrictions
- Hidden manufacturing defects
- Strikes (air traffic control, but NOT airline staff strikes)

## Passenger Rights During Disruption

### Care and Assistance
Airline MUST provide (regardless of compensation):
- Meals and refreshments (proportional to waiting time)
- Hotel accommodation if overnight stay needed
- Transport between airport and accommodation
- 2 phone calls or emails

### Right to Reimbursement or Rerouting
Passenger can choose:
1. **Full refund** within 7 days (for cancelled/delayed >5 hours)
2. **Rerouting** to final destination at earliest opportunity
3. **Rerouting at later date** at passenger's convenience (subject to availability)

## Special Cases

### Denied Boarding (Overbooking)
- Compensation applies immediately (same amounts as above)
- Plus choice of refund or rerouting

### Downgrading (Moved to lower class)
- Short/medium distance: 30% refund of ticket price
- Long distance: 50% refund of ticket price

### Missed Connections
- EU261 applies if:
  - Booked as single ticket
  - Delay at final destination >3 hours
  - Connection NOT customer's fault

## CS Agent Actions

### When Customer Claims EU261 Rights

1. **Verify eligibility**: Check route, airline, delay length
2. **Check extraordinary circumstances**: Weather, ATC, etc.
3. **Inform customer of rights**: Compensation amount, assistance entitlements
4. **Coordinate with airline**: Pineapple assists but airline pays compensation
5. **Document everything**: Customer may claim later if declined

### Important Notes

- Pineapple does NOT pay EU261 compensation (airline responsibility)
- Pineapple CAN assist with claim process
- Compensation is in ADDITION to Pineapple Guarantee benefits
- Customer may be entitled to BOTH EU261 + Guarantee coverage

## Time Limits

- Claims must be filed within **3 years** (varies by country)
- Airlines have 6-8 weeks to respond to claims
- Customers can escalate to national enforcement body if airline refuses
