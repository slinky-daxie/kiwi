# Pineapple Travel Refund Policy

## General Principles

Refunds for virtual interline bookings are complex because tickets are purchased from multiple airlines with different policies. This document outlines Pineapple's approach to refund requests.

## Refund Eligibility

### Customer-Initiated Cancellations

**Within 24 Hours of Booking**
- **Full refund** available for any reason
- Must be requested before first flight departs
- Processing time: 5-7 business days
- No cancellation fee

**After 24 Hours**
- Refund eligibility depends on individual ticket rules
- Most discounted tickets are non-refundable
- Refund amount = ticket value minus airline penalties
- Pineapple service fee (£25) applies

### Airline-Initiated Cancellations
- **Full refund** of affected segments
- Pineapple Guarantee holders: additional compensation voucher
- Processing time: 7-10 business days
- No Pineapple fees charged

### Flight Disruptions (Delays, Missed Connections)
- Refund available if customer chooses not to travel
- Alternative: Rebooking at no additional cost
- Pineapple Guarantee holders: faster processing (24-48 hours)

## Partial Refunds

### Multi-Segment Itineraries
If only one segment is affected:
- Unused segments: Full refund
- Used segments: No refund
- Proportional refund calculated by Pineapple

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Outbound missed, return unused**
- Customer: London → Bangkok → Sydney (both directions)
- Issue: Missed Bangkok-Sydney connection
- Refund: Bangkok-Sydney outbound + full return journey

**Scenario 2: Customer abandons trip mid-journey**
- Customer: London → Dubai → Singapore → Tokyo
- Issue: Customer decides not to continue after Dubai
- Refund: Unused segments (Singapore-Tokyo) only, subject to ticket rules
